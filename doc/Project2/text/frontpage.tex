\begin{abstract}
In this project we first determine the energy of the one-dimensional Ising model using linear regression and deep learning. We will investigate the performance of both Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Ridge regression and Lasso regression, before we turn to a deep feed-forward neural network (FNN) with various activation function and hyper parameters. Secondly, we classify a two-dimensional Ising model using logistic regression and deep learning, and vary the regularization parameter.

To estimate the error, Mean Square Error (MSE) and the R$^2$-score function are used in the regression case, and we find more reliable values by K-fold validation resampling. In the classification case, we will study the accuracy score since the outputs are binary. Gradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are implemented as the minimization tools. 

We found the...

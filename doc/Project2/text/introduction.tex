As late as in 1944 Ising model, the Norwegian-American physicist Lars Onsager

We will in this project classify whether a two-dimensional Ising grid is above or below the critical temperature with deep learning as a tool. Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN) is our tool of choice, and we investigate the performance as the sigmoid function is replaced with more modern activation functions and we adjust the hyperparameters. Various minimization methods will also be studied.

Already in 19... Ising model, Lars Onsager

We will in this project classify whether a two-dimensional Ising grid is above or below the critical temperature with deep learning as a tool. Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN) is our tool of choice, and we investigate the performance as the sigmoid function is replaced with more modern activation functions and we adjust the hyperparameters.

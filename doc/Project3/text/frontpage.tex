\begin{abstract}
The aim of this project is to divide various sounds into ten categories, inspired by the \href{https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-urban-sound-classification/}{Urban Sound Challenge}. For that we have investigated the performance of logistic regression and various neural networks, like Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). 

When it comes to error estimation, accuracy score is a natural choice. Various activation functions were investigated, and regularization was added for the logistic case. Since we mostly used ADAM as optimization tool...
	
To extract features from our dataset (dimensionality reduction), we used a spectrogram in the CNN case, and Mel Frequency Ceptral Coefficients (MFCCs) for FNN and RNN. We also tried two RNN networks, mainly the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network. 

All the neural networks were more or less able to recognize the training set, but it was a significantly difference in validation accuracy. FNN provided the highest validation accuracy of 94\%, followed by LSTM (88\%), GRU (86\%) and CNN (82\%). Our linear model, logistic regression, was only able to classify 60\% of the test set correctly.

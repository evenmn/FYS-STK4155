\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
Even though we did not perform any CPU time analysis, the CNN method is by far the most time consuming, which should be taken into account when deciding which method we prefer. The reason for the difference is that the input into CNN is much larger than the input into the other methods (173 times larger). 

A lot of options, and we have just looked at a fraction of them, so our conclusion is not necessarily correct (?).
